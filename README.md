Analysis of factors that influence student attendance at UCSD events, including funding, location, day of the week, and event type.

# Quantitative Analysis of Club Event Attendance at UCSD
## Overview
This project analyzes factors that influence student attendance at extracurricular events hosted at UC San Diego. We examined how aspects such as:

- Funding

- Location

- Type of Event

- Day of the Week

impact attendance rates. The goal is to support data-driven event planning by identifying which variables most significantly affect turnout.

## Research Question
How well can student attendance rates be predicted by funding, venue location, event type, and date at extracurricular events at UC San Diego?

## Summary of Findings
Using exploratory data analysis on event records, we found:

### Fall Quarter:

Attendance was significantly influenced by Day of the Week and Money Allocated.

Event Type and Location were not significant predictors.

### Winter Quarter:

Attendance was more dependent on Location and Money Allocated.

Event Type and Day of the Week showed no strong correlation.

A predictive model was attempted but not finalized due to insufficient data.
